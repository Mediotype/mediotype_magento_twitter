mediotype_magento_twitter

In order to use this extension, you will need a Twitter account and a Twitter application under that account.  If you don't already have a Twitter account just go to [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and sign up.

###Initializing the Twitter Extension

**The following steps will walk you through how to begin using this extension:**

1. Go to [Twitter's Developer website](https://dev.twitter.com) and sign in to your Twitter account
2. Hover over your avatar in the upper right and click **My Applications** from the drop-down menu
3. Click **Create a new application** and fill out the necessary fields.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Create my access token**
5. Twitter will give you a message saying wait a moment, but you can click the *OAuth tool* tab to find all the info you'll need for this extension
6. Make a note of the *Consumer key*, *Consumer secret*, *Access token*, and *Access token secret* from the *OAuth tool* tab
7. If you haven't already installed the extension on your Magento website, do so now
8. Navigate to the Admin of your website and log in.  This is normally done via **YourWebsiteURL/admin**
9. Hover over **System** and click **Configuration**
10. Scroll down the page and click **Twitter** under the *Mediotype* section on the left
11. Fill in the fields using the information you collected in step 6 and save the configuration

Now you can add your latest Tweets to any page just like any other Magento block.

###Extending the Twitter Extension

Since this extension connects to Twitter via OAuth with a unique OAuth token, developers can utilize this functionality to interact with Twitter beyond what's provided.
